          <p class = "summary"><br> This was my first introduction to Github and the courses proved useful in demonstrating basic Github principles such as pull requests, merging and Markdown. The experience with Github also proved useful later in course when we were working in groups for coding projects. I now use Github as my go to place for organizing all of my coding projects. </p>

    <div class = "well">
      <h3 id = "ihc" class = "ghc"> Intro to HTML/CSS </h3>
      <div class= "row">
        <p class = "col-xs-4 summary"><br> Intro to HTML and CSS was my first experience with designing webpages. Through this course I learned basic html tags, css selectors and page layout. The skills from this course allowed me to create basic webpages and provided a solid foundation for more advanced web design.</p>

      <h3 id = "ijs" class = "ghc"> Intro to JS </h3>
      <div class= "row">
        <p class = "col-xs-8 summary"><br> Introduction to Javascript covered many of the concepts I had learned last year such as loops, logic statements and functions. The difference was working in a more visiual enviroment that utilized coordinates and shapes. Object-oriented design was also briefly discussed in this course which has proven useful for refactoring code I have previously written.</p>

      <h3 id = "ins" class = "ghc"> Natural Simulations </h3>
      <div class= "row">
        <p class = "col-xs-4 summary"><br> Building off intro to JS, Natural Simulations delved deeper into object oriented design by using physics principles to simulate natural behaviors such as acceleration, oscillations and controlled randomness. Although quite a challenge, this module made me more comfortable with using objects. It even taught me a thing or two about concepts not exclusive to programming such as noise and vectors.</p>

      <h3 id = "igv" class = "ghc"> Games and Visualisations </h3>
      <div class= "row">
        <p class = "col-xs-4 summary"><br> Similarly to Natural Simulations, Games and Visualisations also had me learn more about object-oriented design. I learnt about common concepts used in games such as buttons and scene changes. The projects in this module were quite open ended which allowed for a fun learning experience.</p>

      <h3 id = "dom" class = "ghc"> Making Webpages Interactive (DOM)  </h3>
      <div class= "row">
        <p class = "col-xs-6 summary"><br> I had previously seen html and Javascript but this module was the first time I was shown how to combine them. The new script tag allowed me to alter webpages and respond to user actions with the help of event listeners. Manipulating existing html and css on a webpage allows me to now create non-static webpages.</p>

      <h3 id = "ijq" class = "ghc"> Making Webpages Interactive with jQuery  </h3>
      <div class= "row">
        <p class = "col-xs-4 summary"><br> The jQuery library allowed for facilitated use of Javascript in webpages previously seen in DOM. Throughout the course I learned how to implement a slideshow into a webpage, respond to user clicks and process forms. While not always necessary, knowing how to implement these features in the future will likely prove useful.</p>

        <div class = "col-xs-4">
          <p class = "summary"><br> This more theoretical Khan Academy course looked into algorithms, what they are and how to improve efficiency. Cubing was also a part of algorithms and taught me how to approach problems in new ways.</p>

        <p class = "col-xs-4 summary"><br> This course delved into how to create and query databases using various forms of selection statements. While not that helpful with a small amount of data, the ability to find and filter data based on certain requirements seems quite useful if there are thousands of elements in the database.</p>

      <div class= "row">
        <p class = "col-xs-6 summary"><br> The majority of ICS4U was done on Khan Academy which made this module on Free Code Camp a bit different. Although some of the content had been covered in previous modules, there were some new, useful concepts such as string manipulation and parsing. The projects on Free Code Camp were more lenient on what was required which allowed for more creative problem solving.</p>
