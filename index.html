        <p class = "col-xs-6 summary">The majority of ICS4U had been done on Khan Academy and while it is a great resource, changing it up once in a while helps break up the monotony of Khan Academy's teaching format. Free Code Camp's structure focuses more on giving you the raw tools and then allowing you to problem solve with them in the projects. This was different from Khan Academy's approach of trying to guide you to an exact destination. This intro to JS course gave more basic functionalities of Javascript including string manipulation and case statements. It was a nice breath of fresh air.</p>
